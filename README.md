This is a super light-weight lightbox to be easily inserted into any website. 

[Demo](https://nathanwentworth.github.io/lightbox/)

## Installation

1. Download this repo
2. Copy `lightbox.js` and `lightbox.css` into your project folder
3. Add a link to both in your html
4. Add `data-lb-container` to the parent element you want to become the lightbox container. 

## Notes

* Currently only supports one lightbox container per page. Will eventually support multiple!
* Zoom function not currently functioning, will implement at a later time.
